I'm a programmer and deep learning enthusiast. I am studying on personal projects involving machine learning and data science, which I plan to share here (and on my Github: {% include icon-github.html username="yusufdemyr" %}).

Currently, I am student at the Dokuz Eylul University in CS. I always loved creating things, right from school. When computers and internet 
became commonplace, I realized I loved browsing, researching, and playing with 
websites. Everything I've learned along the way is helping me in adding greater 
values on my work.
